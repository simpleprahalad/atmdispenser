ATM Dispenser

The ATM dispenser app is created using React.
A user needs to provide any amount in the app as input and the app would display various notes that would be dispensed by the ATM

The app currently handles the various denominations used in India.
Possible currency values are 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 2000.

Note :
This is an initial commit. I welcome other members to help me improve the interface.
